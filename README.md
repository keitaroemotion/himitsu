credential manipulation terminal app.

## description

Basically for the web developers who needs to input bunch of various credentials, it actually is tiring to memorize their username & password && (company code) etc. Those important credentials, for especially heavy terminal fans or addicts, is really tough. Also, I think it's not that good practice to let browser memorize their credentials, or put it on your excel sheet or memo, or something. 
This app is going to stock credentials as specific encrypted DSL (check `etc/.credential.sample`) file, decrypt it (possible GnuGPG) and according to the user's input get specitic credential blob and copy it onto the clipboard.
